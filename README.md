# WIC Obesity Trends in North Carolina (2016–2020)

This project analyzes trends in weight-related health conditions among WIC-enrolled children aged 3–23 months in North Carolina from 2016 to 2020. It uses a publicly available CDC dataset to visualize differences by race/ethnicity and year.

## Files Included

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all code, graphs, and markdown explanations.
- `Nutrition__Physical_Activity__...csv`: Raw dataset used in the analysis.
- `*.png`: Image files generated from the notebook visualizations.
- `.gitignore` : for ignoring the venv.

## Summary of Results

The analysis found consistent disparities in weight-related health indicators among different racial/ethnic groups, with Hispanic and Black children showing slightly higher percentages of high weight-for-length. While trends remained steady over time, the data suggests deeper social and economic factors may be at play.

## Future Work

Further analysis could include more states, additional years, or combine datasets for deeper insights into health disparities among WIC participants.
